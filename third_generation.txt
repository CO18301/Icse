3rd generation of computers
The 3rd generation of computers were developed in 1965.
This generation of computers lasted for 6 years after which it was replaced in 1971 by the next generation of computers which is the 4th generation of computers.
The 3rd generation of computers work on Integrated Circuits(IC) which has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. The ICÂ’s were developed by Jack Kilby in 1958.
The main features of the 3rd generation of computers are:
	Integrated circuits instead of individual transistors used in the previous two generations.
	Supported high level programming languages.
	Make use of semi-conductor memory.
	Use magnetic storage devices.
	Use monitors and line printers.
	Uses operating system as user interface to computing.
The advantages of 3rd generation of computers over its previous generation :
 	More reliable in comparison to previous generation.
 	Smaller size
 	Generated less heat
 	Faster
 	Lesser maintenance
 	Consumed lesser electricity
 	Improved faster operations and more dependable output
 	 Less expensive than 2nd generation computers
The 4th generation of computers was developed in 1971 and it replaced the 3rd generation of computers due to the following advantages of the 4th over the 3rd generation of computers:
	More reliable than the previous generation
	Performs calculations faster than the 3rd generation of computers
	Consumes less power than the previous generation of    computers
	No air conditioning required as in the case of 3rd generation of computers
	Lower cost
	Used for more general purposes
	Supports more number of high languages
	Low maintenance cost
	Portable
	Generates lesser heat
Thus, the 3rd generation of computers were replaced by the 4th generation of computers.
Some examples of the 3rd generation of computers:
	IBM-360 series
	Honeywell-6000 series
	PDP (Personal Data Processor)
	IBM-370/168
	TDC-316
